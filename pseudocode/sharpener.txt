TITLE: sharpener function pseudocode
DESCRIPTION: this algorithm takes model (matrix) and number 1-5 for strength and diminishes the values that are outstanding

FUNCTION sharpenEnsemble(ensemble, strength)
	sz <- the dimentions of ensemble in array
	average <- set initial average to 0
	FOR set i: 1 to sz[1]
		FOR set j: 1 to sz[2]
			average <- add every value in the matrix
		END
	END
	average <- average divided by the metrix cells count

	FOR set i: 1 to sz[1]
		FOR set j: 1 to sz[2]
			value <- ensemble[i][j]
			percent <- calculate value relation with average by: value * 100 / average
			IF absolute value of "percent" is more than 1000(%)
				SET ensemble[i][j] to be equal itself divided by "strength"
			END
		END
	END
	RETURN ensemble
